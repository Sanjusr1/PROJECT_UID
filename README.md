#  Movie Search App.
Welcome to the Movie Search Website, an interactive platform that helps users explore movies, get detailed cast and rating info, and even chat with a built-in movie assistant. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Movie Search** is a feature-rich, frontend-driven web application designed to offer users a seamless and engaging experience while exploring the world of cinema. Whether you're a casual movie watcher or a hardcore film buff, this platform helps you discover, filter, and interact with movie content effortlessly.

Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website allows users to:

- Search for movies by title
- Browse films by genre using filters (like Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.)
- Check cast information and view ratings.
- Add favorites to a watchlist for easy access later.
- Explore the official websites of the movies which are created by the movie makers.
- Chat with a built-in assistant that provides smart responses to movie-related queries like “What’s the rating of Inception?” or “ What's the age limit to this movie?” .

The chatbot is designed to mimic conversational flow and enrich user interaction beyond the usual UI elements, making the experience both helpful and fun.

Whether you’re planning your next movie night or just browsing for something new, this project is built to assist and entertain. Ideal for showcasing front-end development skills and UI/UX design with potential for future API integrations or backend expansion.
